The history of hidden files
===========================

Ever wondered why there are files on your Linux system, starting with a dot? The short
answer: they are shortcuts. The story begins many years ago when the first file systems
were created on UNIX. To allow easy navigation, a single file with a dot (.) was added to
each directory. Secondly, a double dot file (..) was added to easily move up in the
directory structure. As these files had no real data in them, a quick hack was added to
the ls binary.

The change made to the ls binary involved checking for the first character. If that was a
dot, it should be ignored. And it worked great!

Something which was not anticipated is what we now know as a hidden file. If you create a
file starting with a dot, it will become a file on disk, but which is not displayed by
default. This behavior is the result of the earlier hack applied to the ls binary.
